# A Simple Batman Quiz
_Because who doesn't love Batman, right?_

# Project Overview

I built this project as a response to an assignment during my undergrad Software Engineering course where I was first exposed to JavaScript and, in particular, vue.js.

### Running the program

All you have to do is double-click the index.html file and voila! You'll be able to start the quiz with 5 questions and options on your screen.

### Program Details

This "web app" displays 5 questions with 3 options per question. Clicking the correct option gives you a prompt and adds +5 poins to your total score. 
There are no negative points for incorrect choices.

### Requirements

Latest Chrome/Firefox browser. Not much, really.
